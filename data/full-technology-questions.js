    type: "reading-comprehension",
    options: [
      "The replacement of all traditional industries with digital ones",
      "The convergence of computing power, internet connectivity, and mobile devices",
      "The elimination of human workers in favor of artificial intelligence",
      "The creation of entirely virtual economies separate from physical markets"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    difficulty: "medium",
    explanation: "The passage explicitly states that 'This digital revolution, characterized by the convergence of computing power, internet connectivity, and mobile devices, has created new possibilities while simultaneously presenting complex challenges.'",
    passageText: "The past two decades have witnessed an unprecedented technological transformation that has fundamentally altered nearly every aspect of human life. From the way we communicate and work to how we learn and entertain ourselves, digital technology has become the invisible thread weaving through the fabric of modern society. This digital revolution, characterized by the convergence of computing power, internet connectivity, and mobile devices, has created new possibilities while simultaneously presenting complex challenges.\n\nOne of the most significant developments has been the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning. These technologies are no longer confined to research laboratories but have become integral to everyday applications. AI algorithms now power search engines, recommend products on shopping platforms, detect fraud in financial transactions, and even assist doctors in diagnosing diseases. Machine learning systems continuously improve their performance by analyzing vast amounts of data, leading to increasingly sophisticated applications that can recognize speech, translate languages in real-time, and even generate creative content.\n\nThe widespread adoption of cloud computing has democratized access to powerful computing resources. Small businesses can now access the same computational capabilities that were once exclusive to large corporations, leveling the playing field in many industries. This shift has enabled the rise of countless startups and innovative companies that operate entirely in digital spaces. Remote work, accelerated by global events, has become not just possible but preferable for many organizations, fundamentally changing traditional concepts of workplace and career.\n\nHowever, this technological advancement comes with significant challenges. Privacy concerns have escalated as companies collect unprecedented amounts of personal data. Cybersecurity threats have evolved alongside technological capabilities, requiring constant vigilance and adaptation. The digital divide has become more pronounced, with unequal access to technology creating new forms of social and economic inequality. Additionally, the automation of jobs raises important questions about the future of work and the need for educational systems to adapt to rapidly changing skill requirements.\n\nDespite these challenges, the trajectory of technological development shows no signs of slowing. Emerging technologies like quantum computing, biotechnology, and renewable energy systems promise to address some of humanity's most pressing challenges while creating new opportunities for innovation and growth.",

    explanation: "The passage begins by stating 'The past two decades have witnessed an unprecedented technological transformation.'",
    passageText: "The past two decades have witnessed an unprecedented technological transformation that has fundamentally altered nearly every aspect of human life. From the way we communicate and work to how we learn and entertain ourselves, digital technology has become the invisible thread weaving through the fabric of modern society. This digital revolution, characterized by the convergence of computing power, internet connectivity, and mobile devices, has created new possibilities while simultaneously presenting complex challenges.\n\nOne of the most significant developments has been the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning. These technologies are no longer confined to research laboratories but have become integral to everyday applications. AI algorithms now power search engines, recommend products on shopping platforms, detect fraud in financial transactions, and even assist doctors in diagnosing diseases. Machine learning systems continuously improve their performance by analyzing vast amounts of data, leading to increasingly sophisticated applications that can recognize speech, translate languages in real-time, and even generate creative content.\n\nThe widespread adoption of cloud computing has democratized access to powerful computing resources. Small businesses can now access the same computational capabilities that were once exclusive to large corporations, leveling the playing field in many industries. This shift has enabled the rise of countless startups and innovative companies that operate entirely in digital spaces. Remote work, accelerated by global events, has become not just possible but preferable for many organizations, fundamentally changing traditional concepts of workplace and career.\n\nHowever, this technological advancement comes with significant challenges. Privacy concerns have escalated as companies collect unprecedented amounts of personal data. Cybersecurity threats have evolved alongside technological capabilities, requiring constant vigilance and adaptation. The digital divide has become more pronounced, with unequal access to technology creating new forms of social and economic inequality. Additionally, the automation of jobs raises important questions about the future of work and the need for educational systems to adapt to rapidly changing skill requirements.\n\nDespite these challenges, the trajectory of technological development shows no signs of slowing. Emerging technologies like quantum computing, biotechnology, and renewable energy systems promise to address some of humanity's most pressing challenges while creating new opportunities for innovation and growth.",
