    text: "What was the main outcome of Costa Rica's Payment for Ecosystem Services program?",
    type: "reading-comprehension",
    options: [
      "It increased the country's GDP by 50%",
      "It reversed deforestation, increasing forest cover from 26% to over 52%",
      "It eliminated the need for traditional farming practices",
      "It established Costa Rica as the leading producer of sustainable timber"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    difficulty: "medium",
    explanation: "The passage states that 'This market-based approach has helped Costa Rica become the only tropical country to reverse deforestation, with forest cover increasing from 26% in the 1980s to over 52% today.' This clearly indicates that the primary outcome was reversing deforestation and significantly increasing forest cover.",
    passageText: "The concept of \"ecosystem services\" has revolutionized how we understand the relationship between human prosperity and environmental health. Ecosystem services refer to the countless benefits that healthy, functioning ecosystems provide to humans—clean water, fertile soil, climate regulation, and even cultural inspiration. While these services have traditionally been taken for granted, their economic value is increasingly recognized as essential to sustainable development.\n\nOne remarkable example of this paradigm shift is Costa Rica's pioneering Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) program, established in 1997. Before this initiative, Costa Rica had one of the highest deforestation rates globally, losing approximately 50% of its forest cover. The PES program fundamentally altered this trajectory by compensating landowners for preserving forests rather than converting them to farmland. Landowners receive payments for carbon sequestration, biodiversity protection, watershed maintenance, and landscape beauty preservation. This market-based approach has helped Costa Rica become the only tropical country to reverse deforestation, with forest cover increasing from 26% in the 1980s to over 52% today.\n\nThe success of ecosystem service models extends beyond forestry. In New York City, officials faced a choice: build expensive water filtration plants costing $8-10 billion or restore the Catskill watershed that naturally purifies the city's water supply. By investing $1.5 billion in watershed protection—purchasing land buffers, compensating farmers for sustainable practices, and upgrading sewage treatment—the city saved billions while preserving vital natural systems. This approach demonstrates how integrating ecosystem values into decision-making can yield both environmental and economic benefits.\n\nDespite these successes, challenges remain in quantifying the precise value of ecosystem services and creating equitable compensation systems. Critics argue that placing monetary values on nature risks commodifying essential processes that should be protected regardless of economic benefit. Nevertheless, the ecosystem services framework continues to gain traction as communities worldwide recognize that economic prosperity and environmental protection need not be competing goals but can be mutually reinforcing priorities for sustainable development.",

While these services have traditionally been taken for granted, their economic value is increasingly recognized as essential to sustainable development.\n\nOne remarkable example of this paradigm shift is Costa Rica's pioneering Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) program, established in 1997. Before this initiative, Costa Rica had one of the highest deforestation rates globally, losing approximately 50% of its forest cover. The PES program fundamentally altered this trajectory by compensating landowners for preserving forests rather than converting them to farmland. Landowners receive payments for carbon sequestration, biodiversity protection, watershed maintenance, and landscape beauty preservation. This market-based approach has helped Costa Rica become the only tropical country to reverse deforestation, with forest cover increasing from 26% in the 1980s to over 52% today.\n\nThe success of ecosystem service models extends beyond forestry. In New York City, officials faced a choice: build expensive water filtration plants costing $8-10 billion or restore the Catskill watershed that naturally purifies the city's water supply. By investing $1.5 billion in watershed protection—purchasing land buffers, compensating farmers for sustainable practices, and upgrading sewage treatment—the city saved billions while preserving vital natural systems. This approach demonstrates how integrating ecosystem values into decision-making can yield both environmental and economic benefits.\n\nDespite these successes, challenges remain in quantifying the precise value of ecosystem services and creating equitable compensation systems. Critics argue that placing monetary values on nature risks commodifying essential processes that should be protected regardless of economic benefit.

The PES program fundamentally altered this trajectory by compensating landowners for preserving forests rather than converting them to farmland. Landowners receive payments for carbon sequestration, biodiversity protection, watershed maintenance, and landscape beauty preservation. This market-based approach has helped Costa Rica become the only tropical country to reverse deforestation, with forest cover increasing from 26% in the 1980s to over 52% today.\n\nThe success of ecosystem service models extends beyond forestry. In New York City, officials faced a choice: build expensive water filtration plants costing $8-10 billion or restore the Catskill watershed that naturally purifies the city's water supply. By investing $1.5 billion in watershed protection—purchasing land buffers, compensating farmers for sustainable practices, and upgrading sewage treatment—the city saved billions while preserving vital natural systems. This approach demonstrates how integrating ecosystem values into decision-making can yield both environmental and economic benefits.\n\nDespite these successes, challenges remain in quantifying the precise value of ecosystem services and creating equitable compensation systems. Critics argue that placing monetary values on nature risks commodifying essential processes that should be protected regardless of economic benefit. Nevertheless, the ecosystem services framework continues to gain traction as communities worldwide recognize that economic prosperity and environmental protection need not be competing goals but can be mutually reinforcing priorities for sustainable development.",

    explanation: "The passage explicitly states that 'challenges remain in quantifying the precise value of ecosystem services and creating equitable compensation systems.' These are the two specific challenges mentioned in the text that continue to face the ecosystem services framework.",
    passageText: "The concept of \"ecosystem services\" has revolutionized how we understand the relationship between human prosperity and environmental health. Ecosystem services refer to the countless benefits that healthy, functioning ecosystems provide to humans—clean water, fertile soil, climate regulation, and even cultural inspiration. While these services have traditionally been taken for granted, their economic value is increasingly recognized as essential to sustainable development.\n\nOne remarkable example of this paradigm shift is Costa Rica's pioneering Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) program, established in 1997. Before this initiative, Costa Rica had one of the highest deforestation rates globally, losing approximately 50% of its forest cover. The PES program fundamentally altered this trajectory by compensating landowners for preserving forests rather than converting them to farmland.

    text: "What does the passage suggest about the traditional view of ecosystem services before this 'revolution' in understanding?",
    type: "reading-comprehension",
    options: [
      "They were already well-valued and economically quantified",
      "They were considered too complex to understand or measure",
      "They were taken for granted and their economic value was not recognized",
      "They were only appreciated by environmental scientists"

    correctAnswer: 2,
    difficulty: "medium",
    explanation: "The passage states in the first paragraph that 'While these services have traditionally been taken for granted, their economic value is increasingly recognized as essential to sustainable development.' This directly indicates that the traditional view was to take ecosystem services for granted without recognizing their economic value.",
