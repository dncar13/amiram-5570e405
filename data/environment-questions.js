    text: "What criticism is mentioned regarding the ecosystem services framework?",
    type: "reading-comprehension",
    options: [
      "It doesn't work effectively in developing countries",
      "It places monetary values on nature, potentially commodifying essential natural processes",
      "It requires too much government oversight to implement successfully",
      "It benefits wealthy landowners disproportionately"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    difficulty: "medium",
    explanation: "The passage explicitly states that 'Critics argue that placing monetary values on nature risks commodifying essential processes that should be protected regardless of economic benefit.' This represents the main criticism mentioned of the ecosystem services approach.",
    passageText: "Despite these successes, challenges remain in quantifying the precise value of ecosystem services and creating equitable compensation systems. Critics argue that placing monetary values on nature risks commodifying essential processes that should be protected regardless of economic benefit.",

    text: "What does the Costa Rica example demonstrate about ecosystem services?",
    type: "reading-comprehension",
    options: [
      "That market-based approaches can effectively address environmental challenges",
      "That government regulation is more effective than economic incentives",
      "That ecosystem services are more valuable in tropical countries",
      "That deforestation is inevitable in developing economies"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    difficulty: "medium", 
    explanation: "Costa Rica's PES program is described as a 'market-based approach' that successfully reversed deforestation. This example demonstrates that creating economic incentives (compensating landowners) can be an effective way to protect ecosystem services, showing how market mechanisms can be harnessed for environmental protection.",
    passageText: "The PES program fundamentally altered this trajectory by compensating landowners for preserving forests rather than converting them to farmland. Landowners receive payments for carbon sequestration, biodiversity protection, watershed maintenance, and landscape beauty preservation. This market-based approach has helped Costa Rica become the only tropical country to reverse deforestation.",
