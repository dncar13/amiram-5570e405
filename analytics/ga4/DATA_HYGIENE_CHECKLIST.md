# GA4 Data Hygiene Implementation Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions for cleaning up GA4 data after fixing duplicate events and establishing reliable metrics going forward.

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] **Backup current GA4 configuration** (audiences, conversions, custom dimensions)
- [ ] **Document current conversion rates** for comparison after cleanup
- [ ] **Export raw data** for the last 90 days (via GA4 export or BigQuery)
- [ ] **Notify stakeholders** of upcoming data quality improvements
- [ ] **Schedule implementation** during low-traffic periods if possible

## Step 1: Create GA4 Annotations

### 1.1 Add "Duplicate Events Fixed" Annotation

1. **Access GA4 Admin**:
   - Go to Google Analytics 4 property
   - Click **Admin** ‚Üí **Property** ‚Üí **Events**

2. **Create Annotation** (via GA4 Intelligence):
   - Navigate to any report (e.g., Realtime)
   - Click **Intelligence** (lightbulb icon)
   - Click **Create Annotation**
   - **Title**: "Duplicate Event Bug Fixed"
   - **Date**: [Implementation Date - Today's Date]
   - **Description**: 
     ```
     üîß Fixed duplicate event tracking bug affecting purchase conversions.
     
     Changes implemented:
     ‚Ä¢ Added cryptographic checksum validation for transaction IDs
     ‚Ä¢ Implemented 24-hour sliding window deduplication
     ‚Ä¢ Added database-level idempotency constraints
     ‚Ä¢ Deployed comprehensive E2E testing
     
     Impact: Metrics from this date forward are reliable and duplicate-free.
     Historical data (pre-fix) may contain inflated conversion numbers.
     
     Technical details: See events-audit-report.json in repository.
     ```

### 1.2 Add Historical Data Warning Annotation

1. **Create Second Annotation** for historical data:
   - **Title**: "Data Quality Issue Period"
   - **Date**: [Start of known duplicate events period]
   - **Description**:
     ```
     ‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION: Historical data from this period may contain duplicate events.
     
     Known issues:
     ‚Ä¢ Purchase events may be inflated 2-4x actual numbers
     ‚Ä¢ Revenue metrics may show higher than actual values
     ‚Ä¢ Conversion rates may appear artificially high
     
     Resolution: Fixed on [fix date]. Use "PostFix" audience for reliable data.
     ```

## Step 2: Create "PostFix" Audience Segment

### 2.1 Create Clean Data Audience

1. **Navigate to Audiences**:
   - **Admin** ‚Üí **Property** ‚Üí **Audiences**
   - Click **Create Audience**

2. **Configure Audience**:
   - **Name**: "PostFix - Clean Data"
   - **Description**: "Users with events after duplicate-event fix implementation"
   
3. **Set Conditions**:
   - **Include users when**: Event name = any
   - **First seen**: On or after [fix implementation date]
   - **Event parameters**: (Optional) Include checksum parameter exists

4. **Save Audience**

### 2.2 Create Pre-Fix Comparison Audience

1. **Create Comparison Audience**:
   - **Name**: "PreFix - Historical Data"
   - **Description**: "Users with events before duplicate-event fix (may contain duplicates)"

2. **Set Conditions**:
   - **Include users when**: Event name = purchase OR premium_purchase
   - **First seen**: Before [fix implementation date]

3. **Save Audience**

## Step 3: Update Looker Studio Dashboards

### 3.1 Add Data Quality Disclaimer

1. **Open Main Revenue Dashboard**
2. **Add Text Component** at the top:
   ```
   üìä DATA QUALITY NOTICE
   
   Historical Metrics (Before [Fix Date]):
   ‚Ä¢ May contain duplicate events (2-4x inflation)
   ‚Ä¢ Use with caution for decision making
   
   Current Metrics (After [Fix Date]):
   ‚Ä¢ Fully validated and duplicate-free
   ‚Ä¢ Reliable for analysis and reporting
   
   For clean data analysis, filter by "PostFix - Clean Data" audience.
   ```

3. **Style the Notice**:
   - Background: Light yellow (#FFF3CD)
   - Border: Orange (#FFC107)
   - Font: Bold, 12pt

### 3.2 Add Audience Filter

1. **Add Filter Control**:
   - **Type**: Drop-down list
   - **Dimension**: Audience Name
   - **Default**: PostFix - Clean Data

2. **Apply Filter** to all conversion charts:
   - Revenue charts
   - Conversion rate charts
   - Transaction count charts

### 3.3 Create Before/After Comparison

1. **Add Comparison Chart**:
   - **Chart Type**: Time series
   - **Metric**: Purchase events count
   - **Dimensions**: Date, Audience Name
   - **Date Range**: 30 days before fix to 30 days after fix

2. **Add Annotations** on the chart:
   - Mark the fix implementation date
   - Add expected drop explanation

## Step 4: Update Custom Conversions

### 4.1 Review Current Conversions

1. **Navigate to Conversions**:
   - **Admin** ‚Üí **Property** ‚Üí **Events** ‚Üí **Mark as conversions**

2. **Document Current Settings**:
   - List all conversion events
   - Note conversion values
   - Export current conversion data

### 4.2 Create "Clean" Conversion Events (Optional)

If needed for comparison, create duplicate conversion events with additional validation:

1. **Custom Event**: `purchase_validated`
   - **Conditions**: 
     - Event name = purchase
     - Checksum parameter exists
     - Transaction ID parameter exists

2. **Mark as Conversion**: Enable for new validated events

## Step 5: Implement Data Monitoring

### 5.1 Set Up Realtime Monitoring

1. **Create Custom Report**:
   - **Name**: "Event Quality Monitoring"
   - **Metrics**: Events count, Users count, Conversion events
   - **Dimensions**: Event name, Source/Medium
   - **Filters**: Show only purchase events

2. **Monitor for**:
   - Sudden spikes in events (potential duplicates)
   - Missing transaction ID parameters
   - Events without checksum parameters

### 5.2 Create Anomaly Detection

1. **Intelligence Alerts**:
   - **Alert Type**: Custom
   - **Metric**: Purchase events
   - **Condition**: Increases by more than 50% day-over-day
   - **Recipients**: Analytics team

2. **BigQuery Scheduled Query** (if BigQuery export is enabled):
   - Schedule daily validation query
   - Alert on duplicate detection
   - Monitor event quality scores

## Step 6: Team Communication Plan
