# âœ… INTEGRATION VERIFICATION COMPLETE

## ðŸŽ¯ Task Summary
**Objective**: Ensure the 10 new restatement questions are properly categorized and appear in the medium difficulty mixed practice simulation.

## âœ… Verification Results

### 1. Question Files âœ…
- **File**: `src/data/questions/restatementMediumQuestions.ts`
- **Status**: âœ… VERIFIED
- **Questions**: 10 questions (IDs 301-310) 
- **Fixed**: Resolved ID conflicts (moved from 201-210 to 301-310)
- **Properties**: All questions have `difficulty: "medium"` and `type: "restatement"`

### 2. Question Integration âœ…
- **File**: `src/data/questions/index.ts`
- **Status**: âœ… VERIFIED
- **Import**: `restatementMediumQuestions` properly imported
- **Array**: Questions added to `allQuestions` array with spread operator

### 3. Simulation Component âœ…
- **File**: `src/pages/Simulation.tsx`
- **Status**: âœ… VERIFIED
- **Features**:
  - âœ… Difficulty-based routing (`isDifficultyBased`)
  - âœ… Level/type parameter extraction
  - âœ… Dynamic question source selection (`questionsToUse`)
  - âœ… Proper session storage handling

### 4. Simulation Hook âœ…
- **File**: `src/hooks/useSimulation.tsx`
- **Status**: âœ… VERIFIED
- **Features**:
  - âœ… Handles `difficulty_` prefixed simulation IDs
  - âœ… Filters questions by `difficulty === 'medium'`
  - âœ… Supports both mixed and type-specific practice
  - âœ… Questions state management with `setQuestions`

### 5. Route Handling âœ…  
- **Routes**: Existing route definitions in `App.tsx`
- **URL Pattern**: `/simulation/difficulty/:level/:type`
- **Examples**:
  - `/simulation/difficulty/medium/mixed` (all medium questions)
  - `/simulation/difficulty/medium/restatement` (medium restatement only)

## ðŸš€ Access Points

### Primary Access (Mixed Practice)
- **URL**: `/simulation/difficulty/medium/mixed`
- **Content**: All medium difficulty questions (including the 10 new restatement questions)
- **Navigation**: Home â†’ Practice by Difficulty â†’ Medium â†’ Mixed Practice

### Secondary Access (Restatement Only)
- **URL**: `/simulation/difficulty/medium/restatement`
- **Content**: Only medium difficulty restatement questions (the 10 new questions)
- **Navigation**: Home â†’ Practice by Difficulty â†’ Medium â†’ Restatement

## ðŸ“Š Question Details

### New Questions (IDs 301-310)
- **Type**: restatement
- **Difficulty**: medium
- **Count**: 10 questions
- **Tags**: ["amir-test"]
- **Topic**: Various (university life, business, social situations)

### Integration Flow
1. Questions stored in `restatementMediumQuestions.ts`
2. Imported into `allQuestions` array in `index.ts`
3. Filtered by difficulty/type in `useSimulation` hook
4. Displayed in Simulation component based on route parameters

## âœ… FINAL STATUS: COMPLETE

**The 10 new restatement questions are now properly categorized and accessible through the medium difficulty mixed practice simulation.**

### Test Instructions
1. Navigate to `/simulation/difficulty/medium/mixed`
2. Verify questions include the new restatement questions (IDs 301-310)
3. Check that difficulty filtering works correctly
4. Confirm mixed practice includes all medium questions
5. Test direct restatement access at `/simulation/difficulty/medium/restatement`

### No Issues Found
- âœ… No compilation errors
- âœ… No ID conflicts 
- âœ… Proper TypeScript types
- âœ… Correct question categorization
- âœ… Working route handling
- âœ… Functional difficulty filtering

**Integration is complete and ready for user testing.**
