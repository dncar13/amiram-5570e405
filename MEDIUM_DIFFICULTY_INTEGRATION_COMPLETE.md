# Medium Difficulty Restatement Questions Integration - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary
Successfully integrated 10 new medium-difficulty restatement questions into the application and ensured they appear correctly in the medium difficulty mixed practice simulation.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Simulation Component** (`src/pages/Simulation.tsx`)
- **Added support for difficulty-based URL parameters**: `level` and `type`
- **Enhanced useParams extraction**: Now captures `{ topicId, setId, level, type }`
- **Added difficulty-based simulation logic**: Creates simulation IDs like `difficulty_medium_mixed`
- **Updated question source selection**: Uses `simulation.questions` for difficulty-based, `topicQuestions` for topic-based
- **Enhanced back navigation**: Returns to appropriate difficulty page for difficulty-based simulations
- **Updated simulation header**: Shows proper titles for difficulty-based simulations (e.g., "רמה בינונית - תרגול מעורב")

### 2. **Enhanced useSimulation Hook** (`src/hooks/useSimulation.tsx`)
- **Added difficulty-based question loading**: Handles simulation IDs starting with `difficulty_`
- **Implemented filtering logic**: 
  - For `mixed` type: Gets all questions with matching difficulty
  - For specific types: Gets questions matching both difficulty and type
- **Added questions to return object**: Now exposes `questions` array to components
- **Added comprehensive logging**: Shows question counts for debugging

### 3. **Verified Question Data Structure**
- **Confirmed restatementMediumQuestions.ts**: Contains 10 questions with `difficulty: "medium"`
- **Verified import in index.ts**: Questions are included in `allQuestions` array
- **Validated question service**: `getMediumQuestions()` properly filters by difficulty

## Route Structure

### Existing Routes (Already Working)
- `/simulation/difficulty/medium` - Difficulty selection page
- `/simulation/difficulty/:level/:type` - Generic simulation route

### New Functionality Added
- **Mixed Practice**: `/simulation/difficulty/medium/mixed` 
  - Shows all medium difficulty questions (all types mixed)
  - Includes the 10 new restatement questions
- **Restatement Only**: `/simulation/difficulty/medium/restatement`
  - Shows only medium difficulty restatement questions
  - Includes the 10 new questions

## Question Integration Verification

### Medium Difficulty Questions Distribution
- **Restatement**: 10 new questions (IDs 201-210)
- **Other types**: Existing medium questions
- **Total**: All properly filtered by `difficulty: "medium"`

### Mixed Practice Algorithm
1. **Route**: `/simulation/difficulty/medium/mixed`
2. **Simulation ID**: `difficulty_medium_mixed`
3. **Question Loading**: `allQuestions.filter(q => q.difficulty === 'medium')`
4. **Result**: All medium questions including the 10 new restatement questions

## Technical Implementation Details

### useSimulation Hook Enhancement
```typescript
// New difficulty-based loading logic
if (simulationId.startsWith('difficulty_')) {
  const [_, level, type] = simulationId.split('_');
  
  if (type === 'mixed') {
    // Get all questions of the specified difficulty
    difficultyQuestions = refreshQuestionsFromStorage()
      .filter(q => q.difficulty === level);
  } else {
    // Get questions matching both difficulty and type
    const filteredByDifficulty = refreshQuestionsFromStorage()
      .filter(q => q.difficulty === level);
    difficultyQuestions = filteredByDifficulty
      .filter(q => q.type === type);
  }
}
```

### Simulation Component Enhancement
```typescript
// Added difficulty-based simulation detection
const isDifficultyBased = Boolean(level && type);
const questionsToUse = isDifficultyBased ? simulation.questions : topicQuestions;

// Updated simulation ID generation
const simulationId = isDifficultyBased 
  ? `difficulty_${level}_${type}`
  : setId ? `qs_${setId}` : topicId;
```

## Testing Verification

### Accessibility Paths
1. **Main Entry**: Navigate to "תרגול לפי רמת קושי" → "רמה בינונית" → "תרגול מעורב"
2. **Direct URL**: `/simulation/difficulty/medium/mixed`
3. **Specific Type**: `/simulation/difficulty/medium/restatement`

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ **Question Loading**: 10 new restatement questions appear in medium mixed practice
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Simulation progress saved with unique difficulty-based ID
- ✅ **Navigation**: Back button returns to medium difficulty selection page
- ✅ **UI Display**: Proper Hebrew titles and question type indicators

## Question Sample
**Question #201** (Medium Restatement):
- **Text**: "The university administration has determined that extending library hours during examination periods is financially unfeasible at this time."
- **Correct Answer**: "The university cannot afford to keep the library open longer during exam periods right now."
- **Difficulty**: medium
- **Type**: restatement

## Files Modified
1. `src/pages/Simulation.tsx` - Enhanced for difficulty-based simulations
2. `src/hooks/useSimulation.tsx` - Added difficulty question loading logic
3. `src/data/questions/restatementMediumQuestions.ts` - Already contained the 10 questions
4. `src/data/questions/index.ts` - Already imported the questions

## Status: COMPLETED ✅
The 10 new restatement questions are now:
- ✅ Properly categorized as medium difficulty
- ✅ Integrated into the main questions array
- ✅ Accessible through medium difficulty mixed practice
- ✅ Routable via `/simulation/difficulty/medium/mixed`
- ✅ Functional with progress tracking and navigation

The implementation is complete and ready for use.
