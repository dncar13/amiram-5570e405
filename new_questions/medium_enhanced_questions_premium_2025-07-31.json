      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "התשובה הנכונה היא משפט 2. 'declining steadily' זהה במשמעות ל-'consistently decreasing' - שניהם מתארים ירידה מתמשכת ועקבית ברווחים. 'over the past three years' זהה ל-'for three years'. דוגמה דומה: 'Sales are dropping continuously' = 'Sales are consistently decreasing'.",

      "explanation": "התשובה הנכונה היא משפט 3. 'It is essential that' מבטא חובה מוחלטת, זהה ל-'must'. שני הביטויים מדגישים שההשתתפות היא הכרחית ולא רשות. האפשרויות האחרות מבטאות המלצה או הזמנה, לא חובה. דוגמה דומה: 'It is crucial that you arrive on time' = 'You must arrive on time'.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "התשובה הנכונה היא משפט 1. 'so terrible that' מבטא סיבה ותוצאה, זהה ל-'because... extremely bad'. שני המשפטים מסבירים שמזג האוויר הרע היה הסיבה לביטול הפיקניק. המבנה 'so...that' מציג תוצאה, ו-'because' מציג סיבה. דוגמה דומה: 'It was so cold that we stayed inside' = 'We stayed inside because it was extremely cold'.",

        "She always goes to the cinema these days."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "התשובה הנכונה היא משפט 3. 'rarely' פירושו כמעט לא, זהה ל-'doesn't... very often'. 'these days' ו-'anymore' מתייחסים לתקופה הנוכחית. המשפט מתאר שינוי בהרגלים - בעבר הלכה יותר, כיום פחות. דוגמה דומה: 'He rarely calls me' = 'He doesn't call me very often'.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "התשובה הנכונה היא משפט 3. 'Unless' פירושו 'אם לא', זהה ל-'if... don't'. שני המשפטים מציגים תנאי שלילי - אם לא תלמד יותר, לא תעבור. 'Unless' הוא דרך קצרה לומר 'if not'. התוצאה זהה בשני המקרים. דוגמה דומה: 'Unless it rains, we'll go out' = 'If it doesn't rain, we'll go out'.",
