      "explanation": "המשפט המקורי הוא משפט תנאי מסוג שלישי (Third Conditional) המתחיל ב-inversion של 'Had'. המשפט מביע תנאי בלתי אפשרי בעבר - אילו החברה לא הייתה מגוונת את התיק שלה, היא לא הייתה יכולה לשרוד. האפשרות הנכונה משמרת את המשמעות הזו במבנה תנאי רגיל עם 'If + past perfect' ו-'would have + past participle'. שלוש האפשרויות האחרות משנות את המשמעות: האפשרות השנייה הופכת את המשפט לחיובי, השלישית טוענת שהגיוון נכשל, והרביעית משנה את התוצאה ל'thrived'.",

      "explanation": "המשפט המקורי משתמש במבנה 'Scarcely had...when' שמציין שני אירועים שקרו כמעט בו-זמנית, כאשר האירוע השני קרה מיד אחרי הראשון. המילה 'scarcely' פירושה 'בקושי' או 'כמעט לא', ו'irreconcilable differences' פירושן חילוקי דעות שאי אפשר לגשר עליהם. האפשרות הנכונה משמרת את כל המרכיבים הללו: 'barely started' = 'scarcely commenced', 'major disagreements' = 'irreconcilable differences', ו'almost impossible' = 'virtually impossible'. האפשרויות האחרות משנות את זמן האירועים, חומרת הבעיות, או התוצאה הסופית.",
      "examples": [
        "Scarcely had I arrived when it started raining. = I had barely arrived when it started raining.",

      "grammarRule": "'Scarcely/Hardly + had + subject + past participle + when' indicates two events happening in quick succession with inversion for emphasis.",
      "commonMistakes": "Missing the timing relationship between events, underestimating the severity of 'irreconcilable', or misunderstanding the immediate sequence.",

      "explanation": "המשפט המקורי משתמש במבנה 'Not only...but also' שמדגיש שני הישגים משמעותיים שקרו יחד. המילה 'vindicate' פירושה להוכיח שמשהו נכון או מוצדק, במיוחד אחרי ביקורת. 'Controversial hypothesis' היא השערה שנויה במחלוקת. המשפט אומר שהמחקר לא רק הוכיח שההשערה נכונה, אלא גם חולל מהפכה בכל התחום. האפשרות הנכונה משמרת את שני המרכיבים: 'proved...correct' = 'vindicate', 'disputed theory' = 'controversial hypothesis', ו'transformed' = 'revolutionized'. האפשרויות האחרות או מכחישות את אחד ההישגים או משנות את הקשר ביניהם.",
