      "explanation": "המשפט המקורי הוא משפט תנאי מעורב (mixed conditional) המתחיל ב-inversion של had. הוא מתאר מצב היפותטי בעבר - מה היה קורה אילו הממשלה לא הייתה מתערבת. המשפט מציין שההתערבות המהירה של הממשלה מנעה משבר כלכלי הרסני יותר. רק אפשרות 1 משמרת את המשמעות המדויקת - שההתערבות אכן התרחשה ומנעה נזק גדול יותר. שאר האפשרויות משנות את הזמן, הסיבתיות או התוצאה.",

      "explanation": "המשפט המקורי משתמש במבנה 'Scarcely had... when' שמציין רצף מהיר מאוד של אירועים. זהו מבנה formal המדגיש שהאירוע השני (התנגדות בעלי המניות) התרחש כמעט מיד לאחר הראשון (הכרזת המנכ'ל). המילה 'vehement' מדגישה את עוצמת ההתנגדות. רק אפשרות 1 משמרת את כל הרכיבים: הזמן המיידי ('barely... before'), העוצמה ('strongly opposing'), והרצף הסיבתי הנכון.",
      "examples": [
        "Scarcely had we arrived when it started raining → We had barely arrived before it started raining.",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "המשפט המקורי משתמש במבנה 'Not until... did' שמדגיש שהרשויות לא הכירו בהיקף הבעיה עד לרגע מסוים. המילה 'irrefutable' פירושה בלתי ניתן לערעור, ו'malfeasance' היא מילה פורמלית לעבירות/התנהגות פלילית. המילה 'finally' מדגישה שזה קרה אחרי זמן רב. רק אפשרות 1 משמרת את כל המרכיבים: הזמן המדויק ('only...after'), איכות הראיות ('undeniable'), וההכרה המלאה בהיקף ('extent of wrongdoing').",
      "examples": [
        "Not until midnight did she realize her mistake → She only realized her mistake at midnight.",

      "commonMistakes": "Missing the emphasis on timing ('only after'), downgrading the certainty of evidence, or losing the formal tone of 'malfeasance'.",
      "usageTip": "Not until...did structures emphasize that something happened at a specific point and not before - look for 'only' in the restatement.",
