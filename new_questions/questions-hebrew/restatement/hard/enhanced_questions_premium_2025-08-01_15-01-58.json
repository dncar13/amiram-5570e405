      "explanation": "המשפט המקורי משתמש במבנה היפוך תנאי (conditional inversion) - 'Had + subject + not + past participle' שמשמעותו זהה ל-'If + subject + had not + past participle'. שתי האפשרויות מבטאות תנאי לא מציאותי בעבר (third conditional) עם אותה משמעות מדויקת. האפשרות השנייה משתמשת ב-'unless' שמשנה את המשמעות, השלישית משנה את המבנה למשפט חיובי, והרביעית מחלישה את הוודאות מ-'would have' ל-'might have' ומשנה את חומרת התוצאה.",

      "grammarRule": "Conditional inversion: 'Had + subject + (not) + past participle' equals 'If + subject + had (not) + past participle' in third conditional sentences",

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "המשפט המקורי משתמש במבנה 'Scarcely had + subject + past participle + when' שמציין פעולה שקרתה כמעט מיד אחרי פעולה אחרת. המילה 'scarcely' פירושה 'barely' או 'hardly', והמבנה דורש היפוך של הפועל העזר. האפשרות הנכונה משמרת את המשמעות המדויקת עם 'barely'. האפשרויות האחרות, למרות שמבטאות רצף זמני מהיר, לא משמרות את הדיוק של 'כמעט לא הספיק' ולא משתמשות במילים בעלות אותה עוצמה כמו 'dramatically' מול 'significantly'.",
      "examples": [
        "Scarcely had we arrived when it started raining. = We had barely arrived when it started raining.",
        "Hardly had she finished speaking when the audience erupted in applause. = She had barely finished speaking when the audience erupted in applause."

      "grammarRule": "Negative adverbs (scarcely, hardly, barely) at sentence beginning require subject-auxiliary inversion: 'Scarcely/Hardly had + subject + past participle'",
      "commonMistakes": "Forgetting the inversion after negative adverbs, or using 'than' instead of 'when' after 'scarcely/hardly'",
      "usageTip": "These constructions are formal and emphatic - use them to highlight the immediate sequence of events",

      "explanation": "המשפט המקורי משתמש במבנה 'Not until + clause + auxiliary + subject + main verb' שהוא צורת היפוך של 'subject + auxiliary + not + main verb + until + clause'. המילים 'not until' יוצרות היפוך חובה של הפועל העזר והנושא. האפשרות הנכונה משמרת את המשמעות המדויקת ללא היפוך. האפשרות השנייה משנה ל-'only after' שהיא משמעות שונה מעט, השלישית מסירה את השלילה, והרביעית משנה 'realize' ל-'understand' ומוסיפה 'how serious' במקום 'full extent'.",
      "examples": [
