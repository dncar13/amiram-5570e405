      "explanation": "המשפט המקורי משתמש במבנה היפוך תנאי (conditional inversion) עם 'Had + subject + not + past participle'. זהו מבנה פורמלי המקביל למשפט תנאי מסוג שלישי. האפשרות הנכונה משמרת את המשמעות המדויקת: ההתערבות המהירה של הוועדה מנעה קריסה בלתי הפיכה של הפרויקט. האפשרויות האחרות משנות את הזמן הדקדוקי, מחלישות את התוצאה או משנות את מידת הוודאות של התוצאה.",

      "grammarRule": "Conditional inversion with 'Had + subject + not + past participle' equals 'If + subject + hadn't + past participle' in third conditional sentences expressing hypothetical past situations.",
      "commonMistakes": "Confusing with second conditional (would collapse instead of would have collapsed) or changing the certainty level of the consequence.",
      "usageTip": "Conditional inversion is formal and often appears in academic writing. Always maintain the same conditional type and certainty level when restating.",

      "explanation": "המשפט המקורי משתמש במבנה היפוך עם 'Scarcely had + subject + past participle + when', המבטא שני אירועים שקרו כמעט בו-זמנית, כאשר השני קרה מיד אחרי הראשון. האפשרות הנכונה 'As soon as' משמרת את המשמעות של רצף מיידי. האפשרויות האחרות משנות את הזמן (barely implemented מרמז על יישום חלקי), את הרצף (before מרמז שהתלונות החלו לפני היישום המלא), או מפשטות יתר על המידה.",
      "examples": [
        "Scarcely had we arrived when it started raining. = As soon as we arrived, it started raining.",

      "grammarRule": "'Scarcely/Hardly had + subject + past participle + when' expresses immediate sequence and equals 'As soon as + subject + simple past' with subject-auxiliary inversion after negative adverbs.",

      "usageTip": "Negative adverbs like 'scarcely' and 'hardly' at sentence beginning require inversion and express immediate temporal sequence, not incomplete actions.",
