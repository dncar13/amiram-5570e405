      "explanation": "המשפט המקורי משתמש במבנה היפותטי מורכב עם היפוך (inversion) - 'Had the committee not intervened' במקום 'If the committee had not intervened'. המשמעות היא שהוועדה כן התערבה בזמן הנכון, ובזכך הפרויקט לא נפגע באופן בלתי הפיך. אפשרות 1 משמרת את המשמעות הזו בדיוק. אפשרות 2 מרמזת שהפרויקט כן נפגע חלקית. אפשרות 3 הופכת את המשמעות לחלוטין. אפשרות 4 מציעה ביקורת על התזמון, לא את המשמעות המקורית.",

      "grammarRule": "Third conditional with inversion: 'Had + subject + past participle' equals 'If + subject + had + past participle'. This structure expresses hypothetical past situations.",

      "usageTip": "When you see 'Had + subject + past participle' at the beginning of a sentence, remember it's a formal way of expressing an unreal past condition.",

      "explanation": "המשפט המקורי משתמש במבנה 'Scarcely had... when...' שמבטא רצף מהיר של אירועים. המילה 'scarcely' (בקושי) עם היפוך מציינת שמיד אחרי ההכרזה על המיזוג, בעלי המניות החלו למכור בפאניקה. אפשרות 1 משמרת את המשמעות עם 'barely... before'. אפשרות 2 מרמזת על המתנה. אפשרות 3 מכחישה את המכירה המיידית. אפשרות 4 הופכת את סדר הסיבה והתוצאה.",

      "explanation": "המשפט המקורי משתמש במבנה 'Not until... did...' שמדגיש את נקודת הזמן שבה משהו קרה. המילים 'Not until' בתחילת המשפט גורמות להיפוך בסדר המילים. המשמעות היא שהרשויות הבינו את מלוא היקף השחיתות רק כשהחקירה הסתיימה. אפשרות 1 מבטאת את אותה המשמעות בדיוק ללא היפוך. אפשרות 2 מרמזת על רצף זמנים שונה. אפשרות 3 ממעיטה בחומרת השחיתות. אפשרות 4 הופכת את סדר האירועים.",
