      "explanation": "המשפט המקורי משתמש במבנה היפותטי הפוך (inverted conditional) 'Had + subject + not + past participle' שמבטא תנאי לא מומש בעבר. זהו מבנה פורמלי מאוד השווה ל-'If + past perfect'. האפשרות הנכונה משמרת את אותו המשמעות בדיוק - הממשלה כן התערבה, ולכן המשבר לא היה קטסטרופלי כפי שהיה יכול להיות. שאר האפשרויות משנות את המשמעות או מציגות מידע שונה על התוצאות בפועל.",

        "Had I known about the meeting, I would have attended. = If I had known about the meeting, I would have attended.",

      ],
      "grammarRule": "Inverted conditionals use 'Had + subject + past participle' to replace 'If + past perfect' in third conditional sentences, expressing unreal past conditions.",
      "commonMistakes": "Students often confuse inverted conditionals with real past events, or mix up the time reference between what actually happened and what could have happened.",
      "usageTip": "Inverted conditionals are formal structures. Always remember that 'Had + subject + not + past participle' describes something that DID happen, contrary to the negative form.",

      "explanation": "המשפט המקורי משתמש במבנה היפוך עם 'Scarcely had' שמבטא שפעולה אחת התרחשה כמעט מיד אחרי השנייה. זהו מבנה ספרותי פורמלי שדורש היפוך של הפועל העזר והנושא. המשמעות היא שהתקנות יושמו וכמעט מיד החלו התלונות. האפשרות הנכונה משתמשת ב-'barely' (כמעט לא/בקושי) שמשמר את אותה המשמעות של זמן קצר מאוד בין שתי הפעולות. שאר האפשרויות משנות את רצף הזמנים או את הקשר בין האירועים.",
      "examples": [

      ],
      "grammarRule": "Negative adverbs like 'scarcely', 'hardly', 'barely' at the beginning of sentences require subject-auxiliary inversion and express that one action happened almost immediately after another.",
      "commonMistakes": "Students often forget the inversion rule or confuse the time sequence, thinking 'scarcely had X happened when Y' means Y happened before X.",
      "usageTip": "Remember that 'Scarcely/Hardly had + subject + past participle + when' = 'Subject + had + barely/hardly + past participle + when' - both show immediate sequence.",
