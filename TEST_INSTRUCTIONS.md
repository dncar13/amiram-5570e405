# Set Progress Tracking - Testing Instructions

## ✅ Step 1: Database Setup (COMPLETED)
You have successfully run the SQL script in Supabase. The following have been set up:
- ✅ `updated_at` column added to `simulation_sessions` table
- ✅ Proper indexes created for performance
- ✅ RLS policies configured correctly
- ✅ Debug view (`set_progress_debug`) created
- ✅ Validation functions added

## ✅ Step 2: Code Implementation (COMPLETED)
The following components have been implemented:
- ✅ Enhanced `SetProgressService` with comprehensive logging
- ✅ `SetProgressDebug` component for testing and monitoring
- ✅ Debug route added to App.tsx (development only)
- ✅ All TypeScript types updated

## Step 3: Testing Process

### 3.1 Access the Debug Dashboard
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8080/debug/set-progress`
3. Login if prompted

### 3.2 Run Automated Tests
1. Click "Run All Tests" button
2. Verify all 4 tests pass:
   - ✅ **Create Session**: Creates a test session with proper metadata
   - ✅ **Update Session**: Updates an existing session
   - ✅ **Metadata Validation**: Ensures invalid metadata is rejected
   - ✅ **RLS Policies**: Confirms users can only see their own data

### 3.3 Test Real Set Progress
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8080/simulation/type/restatement/easy/sets`
2. Start any set (e.g., "סט 1")
3. Answer 2-3 questions
4. Exit the simulation (go back to sets page)
5. Check the debug dashboard:
   - Go to "Debug View" tab
   - Verify a session appears with:
     - `is_set_based: true`
     - `set_type: restatement`
     - `set_difficulty: easy`
     - `set_id: 1`
     - `answered_questions: 2-3`
     - `status: in_progress`

### 3.4 Test Progress Display
1. Return to: `http://localhost:8080/simulation/type/restatement/easy/sets`
2. Verify the set card shows:
   - ✅ **Status**: "בהתקדמות" (in progress) with yellow/blue indicator
   - ✅ **Progress bar**: Shows actual progress (e.g., 30%)
   - ✅ **Current question**: Shows question number (e.g., "שאלה 3 מתוך 10")
   - ✅ **Continue button**: Available and functional

### 3.5 Test Resume Functionality
1. Click "המשך" (Continue) button
2. Verify you return to the exact question where you left off
3. Answer another question
4. Return to sets page
5. Verify progress updated correctly

### 3.6 Test Completion
1. Complete an entire set (answer all 10 questions)
2. Return to sets page
3. Verify the set card shows:
   - ✅ **Status**: "הושלם" (completed) with green indicator
   - ✅ **Score**: Final score percentage
   - ✅ **Time**: Time spent
   - ✅ **Buttons**: "התחל מחדש" (restart) and "צפה בתוצאות" (view results)

## Step 4: Console Monitoring

### 4.1 Expected Console Logs
When testing, you should see these console messages:

**When starting a set:**
```
🔍 [SetProgressService] Fetching set progress summary for: {userId, setType, setDifficulty}
📊 Found sessions: 0
📈 Final summary: {}
```

**When answering questions:**
```
🔍 Checking set parameters: {setId: "1", setStart: "0", type: "restatement", difficulty: "easy"}
🔍 Current state: {currentQuestionIndex: 1, answeredCount: 1, correctCount: 1}
💾 [SetProgressService] Saving set progress: {userId, setId: 1, setType: "restatement", ...}
✅ Set progress created successfully
```

**When returning to sets page:**
```
🔍 [SetProgressService] Fetching set progress summary for: {userId, setType, setDifficulty}
📊 Found sessions: 1
🔍 Processing session: {id: "...", setId: 1, setType: "restatement", status: "in_progress", ...}
✅ Added progress for set 1: {set_id: 1, status: "in_progress", progress_percentage: 30, ...}
📈 Final summary: {1: {...}}
```

### 4.2 Troubleshooting Common Issues

**If no sessions are found:**
1. Check authentication: User must be logged in
2. Verify metadata structure in Debug View
3. Check RLS policies are working correctly

**If progress doesn't display:**
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify metadata contains all required fields
3. Check if `is_set_based` is set to `'true'`
4. Verify `set_type` and `set_difficulty` match exactly

**If saving fails:**
1. Check authentication status
2. Verify all required metadata fields are present
3. Check database constraints and policies
4. Look for TypeScript/validation errors

## Step 5: Cleanup

### 5.1 Clean Test Data
1. In the debug dashboard, click "Clean Test Data"
2. This removes any test sessions created during testing

### 5.2 Production Considerations
- The debug route is only available in development mode
- All console.log statements can be removed or disabled in production
- The enhanced logging helps with debugging but should be minimized in production

## Success Criteria

The system is working correctly if:
- ✅ All 4 automated tests pass
- ✅ Set progress is saved to database when answering questions
- ✅ Progress displays correctly on set cards (status, progress bar, current question)
- ✅ Users can resume from where they left off
- ✅ Completed sets show final scores and completion status
- ✅ Multiple sets can be tracked independently
- ✅ Progress persists across browser sessions

## Next Steps

Once testing is complete and successful:
1. Remove or reduce console.log statements for production
2. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling
3. Add unit tests for the SetProgressService
4. Monitor performance with the new indexes and queries
5. Consider adding progress analytics and reporting features
