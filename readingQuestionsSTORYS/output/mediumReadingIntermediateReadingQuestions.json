  "passage": "The Hidden Power of Reading Strategy\n\n[1] Many students approach reading as a passive activity, simply letting their eyes move across the page without much thought or intention. However, research shows that active reading strategies can dramatically improve both comprehension and retention of written material. These strategies, when properly implemented, transform reading from a mere passive exercise into an engaging intellectual pursuit that yields lasting benefits for learners at all levels.\n\n[2] One particularly effective approach is the SQ3R method, which stands for Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and Review. Before diving into a text, successful readers first survey the material by examining headings, subheadings, and visual elements to get an overview of the content. They then generate questions about what they expect to learn, actively read while seeking answers to these questions, recite key points in their own words, and finally review the material to ensure thorough understanding. This systematic approach helps readers maintain focus and extract maximum value from their reading sessions.\n\n[3] The benefits of strategic reading extend far beyond the classroom. Professionals who employ active reading techniques report higher levels of information retention, improved critical thinking skills, and greater success in their careers. For instance, lawyers who use strategic reading methods can analyze complex legal documents more efficiently, while medical professionals can better keep pace with rapidly evolving research in their field. Furthermore, studies indicate that individuals who regularly practice active reading strategies are more likely to engage in lifelong learning and maintain cognitive flexibility as they age.\n\n[4] Despite these clear advantages, many readers resist adopting strategic approaches, believing them to be too time-consuming or complicated. However, with regular practice, these techniques become natural habits that actually save time by reducing the need for rereading and increasing the speed of comprehension. The initial investment in learning and implementing reading strategies pays dividends throughout one's academic and professional life, making it an essential skill for success in our information-rich world.",
