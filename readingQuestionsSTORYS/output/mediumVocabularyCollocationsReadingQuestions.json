  "passage": "The Perfect Match: Words That Love Company\n\n[1] Just as people form natural friendships and partnerships, words in the English language have their own special relationships. These word partnerships, known as collocations, are combinations that native speakers use instinctively but often puzzle learners of English. For instance, while we naturally say \"heavy rain\" or \"strong wind,\" it would sound peculiar to say \"heavy wind\" or \"strong rain,\" even though these words have similar meanings in other contexts.\n\n[2] The fascinating world of collocations extends far beyond weather descriptions. In business English, we \"launch\" a product, \"conduct\" research, and \"reach\" a conclusion. Each verb has found its perfect match through years of linguistic evolution and common usage. Similarly, in academic writing, students \"draw\" conclusions, \"raise\" questions, and \"make\" progress. These partnerships are so firmly established that using alternative combinations, even if technically correct, might make your writing appear less sophisticated or even incorrect to native speakers.\n\n[3] Understanding collocations becomes even more crucial when we examine idiomatic expressions and formal writing. A speaker might \"pay attention\" but never \"give attention,\" just as one \"takes responsibility\" rather than \"accepts responsibility.\" In professional contexts, we \"submit proposals,\" \"implement solutions,\" and \"address concerns.\" These combinations have become standardized through consistent usage across various fields and industries, creating a sort of linguistic DNA that defines proper English expression.\n\n[4] The mastery of collocations marks a significant milestone in language proficiency. While vocabulary size matters, knowing which words naturally go together can transform basic communication into eloquent expression. This knowledge helps speakers avoid the awkward combinations that often betray non-native usage, such as saying \"do a mistake\" instead of \"make a mistake.\" As language learners progress, they discover that learning words in isolation is far less effective than understanding these natural partnerships that make English both challenging and rich.",
