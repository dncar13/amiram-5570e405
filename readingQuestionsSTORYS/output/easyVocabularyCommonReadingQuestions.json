  "passage": "[1] Words are the building blocks of communication, and having a rich vocabulary helps us express our thoughts more clearly. When we know more words, we can choose exactly the right one to share our ideas, feelings, and opinions. Simple words like \"good\" or \"bad\" only tell part of the story, but specific words like \"excellent,\" \"fantastic,\" or \"terrible\" paint a more detailed picture.\n\n[2] Learning new words happens naturally through reading and conversation. When we read books, magazines, or websites, we encounter unfamiliar words in context, which helps us understand their meanings. Talking with friends, family, and teachers also introduces us to different ways of expressing ideas. Even watching educational videos or listening to podcasts can expand our word knowledge.\n\n[3] The best way to remember new vocabulary is to use it regularly. Writing in a journal, participating in class discussions, or explaining topics to others gives us practice with new words. Some people keep vocabulary notebooks where they write down interesting words they discover. Others play word games or use flashcards to review new terms. With consistent practice, these words become natural parts of our everyday speech.",
