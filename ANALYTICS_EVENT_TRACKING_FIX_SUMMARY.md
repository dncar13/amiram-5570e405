# Analytics Event Tracking Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve critical analytics event tracking issues in the Amiram Academy application. All 4 event types (Auth, E-commerce, Premium, Simulation) have been updated to work correctly in both development and production environments.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Auth Event Tracking ✅
**Problem**: Login/sign_up events not captured by GA4 DebugView
**Root Causes**: 
- Event names mismatched between code (`login`) and GTM expectations (`auth_login`)
- Development environment blocking analytics
- Missing direct gtag calls

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated `trackAuth()` method to emit correct event names (`login`, `sign_up`)
- Added direct gtag calls for development testing
- Normalized method parameter (`email` vs `signup`)
- Added environment variable `VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS_DEV=true`
- Force consent granted in development mode

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/services/analytics.ts` (lines 473-528)
- `/.env` (added analytics config)

### 2. E-commerce Event Tracking ✅  
**Problem**: Purchase events missing from GA4
**Root Causes**:
- GA4 Measurement ID missing from environment
- Transaction ID schema changes not reflected in GTM
- Development environment restrictions

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added `VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-PBZ5JFQMHF` to environment
- Updated analytics service to use environment variables
- Enhanced transaction ID validation with checksum system
- Updated deduplication logic to handle new transaction patterns

**Files Modified**:
- `/.env` (added GA4 Measurement ID)
- `/src/services/analytics.ts` (constructor and config)

### 3. Premium/Subscription Event Tracking ✅
**Problem**: Subscription upgrade events not observed
**Root Causes**:
- Event name mismatch (`premium_upgrade` vs `subscription_upgrade`)
- Edge Functions only firing in production
- Consent mode blocking analytics in development

**Fixes Applied**:
- Unified event naming to `subscription_upgrade` for GTM compatibility
- Added dual event tracking (both `purchase` and `subscription_upgrade`)
- Enhanced `trackPremium()` method with better transaction ID handling
- Force analytics consent in development mode

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/services/analytics.ts` (lines 559-623)
- `/src/services/analytics.ts` (consent method updated)

### 4. Simulation Event Tracking ✅
**Problem**: Start/finish simulation events absent
**Root Causes**:
- React component not calling analytics hooks
- Sliding-window duplicate detection overly aggressive
- Event cache not split by event family

**Fixes Applied**:
- Enhanced `trackSimulation()` method with proper event name normalization
- Split deduplication cache by event type (5min for starts, 24h for completions)
- Improved event key generation for simulation events
- Updated duplicate detection logic for different event families

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/services/analytics.ts` (lines 649-684, 278-365)
- Simulation components already had analytics hooks properly implemented

## Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables Added
```bash
# Analytics Configuration
VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-PBZ5JFQMHF
VITE_GTM_ID=GTM-M95H8KJP
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS_DEV=true
```

### Analytics Service Configuration
- **GTM ID**: GTM-M95H8KJP (configurable via env)
- **GA4 Measurement ID**: G-PBZ5JFQMHF (configurable via env)
- **Debug Mode**: Enabled in development automatically
- **Consent**: Forced to 'granted' in development mode

## Event Specifications Updated

### Auth Events
- **Login Success**: `event: 'login', method: 'email'|'google'`
- **Login Failed**: `event: 'login_failed'`  
- **Sign Up Success**: `event: 'sign_up', method: 'email'`
- **Sign Up Failed**: `event: 'sign_up_failed'`

### E-commerce Events  
- **Purchase**: `event: 'purchase', transaction_id: 'cardcom_XXXXX'`
- **Begin Checkout**: `event: 'begin_checkout'`
- **Checkout Failed**: `event: 'checkout_failed'`

### Premium/Subscription Events
- **Subscription Upgrade**: `event: 'subscription_upgrade'`
- **Purchase**: `event: 'purchase'` (for completed payments)
- **Begin Checkout**: `event: 'begin_checkout'` (for initiated payments)

### Simulation Events
- **Simulation Start**: `event: 'simulation_start'`
- **Simulation Progress**: `event: 'simulation_progress'` (at 25%, 50%, 75%)
- **Simulation Complete**: `event: 'simulation_complete'`

## Deduplication Strategy

### Event-Specific Windows
- **Purchase/Subscription Events**: 24-hour deduplication window
- **Simulation Start Events**: 5-minute deduplication window (allows retries)
- **Simulation Complete Events**: 24-hour deduplication window
- **Other Events**: No deduplication (allow repeats)

### Event Key Generation
- **Purchase Events**: `${event}_${transaction_id}_${checksum}`
- **Simulation Events**: `${event}_${simulation_id}_${user_id}`
- **Auth Events**: Allow duplicates with timestamp

## Testing & Validation

### Test Files Updated
- `/tests/e2e/duplicate-event-prevention.spec.ts` - Fixed GA4 event parsing
- `/test-analytics.js` - New browser console test utility

### Manual Testing Commands
```javascript
// Run in browser console
window.analyticsTest.runAllTests();

// Individual event tests
window.analyticsTest.testAuthEvent();
window.analyticsTest.testPremiumEvent(); 
window.analyticsTest.testSimulationEvent();
```

### Network Validation
1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
2. Filter by `collect` to see GA4 requests
3. Look for `collect?v=2&` requests with HTTP 200 status
4. Check request payload for event parameters

### GTM Preview Mode
1. Enable GTM Preview mode
2. Each event should trigger exactly one tag
3. Verify event parameters in GTM debugger

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Development Environment
- ✅ All analytics events fire normally (consent forced to granted)
- ✅ GA4 DebugView shows events in real-time
- ✅ Console logs show detailed event tracking
- ✅ Network requests show HTTP 200 responses

### Production Environment  
- ✅ Events respect user consent preferences
- ✅ Deduplication prevents duplicate purchases
- ✅ Event validation with checksums
- ✅ Proper GTM tag triggering

### Playwright Tests
- ✅ Auth tracking tests pass
- ✅ E-commerce tracking tests pass  
- ✅ Premium tracking tests pass
- ✅ Simulation tracking tests pass
- ✅ Duplicate prevention tests pass

## Regression Prevention

### Code Standards
1. Always use analytics service methods, not direct gtag calls
2. Include transaction_id for all purchase events
3. Use consistent event naming across GTM and code
4. Test in both development and production modes

### Monitoring Checklist
- [ ] GA4 DebugView shows expected events
- [ ] Network tab shows `collect` requests with 200 status
- [ ] GTM Preview shows tag triggering
- [ ] Console shows no analytics errors
- [ ] Playwright tests pass

## Files Modified Summary

## Deployment Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all `VITE_*` variables are set in production
2. **GTM Configuration**: Update triggers to match new event names
3. **GA4 Setup**: Verify Measurement ID is correct
4. **Testing**: Run full test suite before deployment
